#Use this to determine what can be considered an anomaly

#We can use various plotting software, numpy, pandas in order to get the information required from the packets

#Sample packets exist on wireshark (and probably other platforms?) so if you need quick good data grab some

#TODO This is where you can do the machine learning portion. I would recommend XGB or logistic regression (classification)
#where one is a good packet, and the other isn't. This would require you to gather data yourselfs likely.
#See clumsy on github for an artificial network hinderance.
